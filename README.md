# s3-cli

A simple CLI tool to manage S3 buckets and files from the terminal

## Setup

### Install

1. Clone this repository
    a. `git clone https://github.com/0x5b62656e5d/s3-cli` or `gh repo clone 0x5b62656e5d/s3-cli`
2. Install the binary to path
    a. `cargo install --path .`

### Environment variables setup

This tool requires API keys acquired from a S3 service. API keys must be granted `Admin Read & Write` in order for bucket and file management to work properly.

Create a `config.toml` file under `~/.config/s3-cli/`

Configuration template:
```toml
[default]
key_id = "Key ID"
secret_key = "Secret Key"
endpoint_url = "Endpoint URL"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If AWS S3 is being used, make sure to leave `endpoint_url` blank. `endpoint_url` is only required for non-AWS S3 users.
